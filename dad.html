    <h2>BIOGRAPHY OF MR. SAMUEL WINFRED NII OFEI DODOO</h2>
    
<p><u>23rd May, 1948 – 1st May, 2025</u>

<i>“Revelation Verses 9–17: “A great multitude from every nation, clothed in white robes and holding palm branches, stands before the throne of God and the Lamb (Jesus). They worship and serve God continually. It is revealed that they came out of the great tribulation. God promises to shelter them, wipe away their tears, and give them eternal peace.”</i>
<br><br>
Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo, affectionately called Nii Offei, was born on 23rd May 1948 at Kimbu Hospital in Accra to Mr. Benjamin Ernest Okoe Dodoo of the Klemeno Dynasty and Madam Rose Naadu Nelson Addico of Addico We, Prampram – both of blessed memory.
<br><br>
Though he lost his father at the tender age of two, young Nii Offei was embraced by the strong arms of family. He was raised under the watchful care of his uncle, the late Lawyer T.A. Nelson-Cofie, a respected figure who had just returned from the UK. A man of deep Christian faith, he was baptized at just three years old at St. Michael’s Anglican Church, Korle Gonno, in December 1951. Nii Offei began his education at the Salvation Army School near Mamprobi in 1954, completing in 1964. He furthered his studies at Osu Salem Secondary School, laying a strong academic foundation that would serve him well in his professional life.
 His spiritual journey was shaped by his upbringing in a devout Christian household, where his uncle was both church elder and choirmaster at Teshie-Nungua United Church. There, Nii Offei found his place in the choir, singing bass with a deep, rich voice that echoed his soulful character. He never missed a rehearsal – the music, the harmony, the fellowship – it was all part of his life’s rhythm.
<br><br>
 The household in Teshie-Nungua Estates was a lively one, filled with siblings and cousins, yet Nii Offei stood out – quiet, composed, and always impeccably mannered. Though reserved by nature, he had a sharp wit and when he did speak, his humor would leave everyone in stitches.
<br><br>
He started his career at the National Tobacco Rehandling Company Ltd at Tema, where he served diligently as an Accounts Officer. His commitment to duty was unwavering, and he quickly became known as a man of integrity and quiet diligence. There a colleague called Mr. Doku introduced him to Tema Regual Baptist Church .
 It was during this season that he met the love of his life, Miss Rita Addo-Yobo – a woman of grace and strength, known for her generosity and spiritual fervor. Their union was blessed with five children: Mrs. Clara Naa Dodua Omilana Dodoo, Teresa Naa Amponsah Dodoo, Nii Amu Dodoo, Mrs. Rosaline Naa Tsetse Adafia, and Samuel Percy Dodoo. He also had a daughter from an earlier relationship, also named Seyram Naa Dodua Dodoo. His legacy lives on in them, and in his eight adoring grandchildren
<br><br>

When the company was liquidated in the early 1990s as part of Ghana’s economic reform and divestiture program, Nii Offei received his residence in Community 8, Tema as part of his terminal benefits – a place that would became his home and sanctuary for the remainder of his life.
<br><br>
Following his work at the tobacco company, Nii Offei continued to serve his community as the Administrative manager and Accountant of Tema Regular Baptist Academy (TRBA) He served with passion and commitment for 25 remarkable years, There, he was deeply respected by both staff and students, not just for his work ethic, but for the quiet wisdom and kindness he carried with him.
 He was employed in the School on the 5th of January 1995 and retired in June 2020 when his health began to fail him. . 
<br><br>
Though soft-spoken, Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo was a man of great depth – thoughtful, humorous in the most unexpected moments, faithful in service, and unwavering in love for his family and God.

He left behind a legacy rooted in humility, laughter, music, and quiet strength.
<br><br>
Rest well, Nii Offei. You sang your part beautifully.
<br>
MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PERFECT PEACE</p>

   <h2>TRIBUTE FROM CHILDREN</h2>
   <p>If strength had a quiet voice, and wisdom wore a smile, it would look and sound like our father, Mr. Samuel Winfred Dodoo. Calm yet firm, gentle yet principled—he was a man whose love spoke louder in action than in words. He didn’t just raise children; he nurtured hearts, built character, and shaped futures with patience, discipline, and unwavering devotion. <br><br>
  He showed us what unconditional love truly means.Dad lived generously. Every year on his birthday—and often even before—he would quietly send out gifts to widows and widowers in the community. He was a giver at heart, and service was his joy. A quiet, calm, and collected man, he carried a witty charm and a sense of humor that made him unforgettable.<br><br>
  Our home was always filled with music—his deep love for hymns and melodies echoing from his keyboard and his soul. His voice could lift a room, and his joy for the great hymns of old lives on through us. He was also a man of deep intellect—a lover of books, Scripture, and the news. He instilled in us a hunger for knowledge, a respect for words, and a passion for excellence. His corrections made us smarter. His example made us better.<br><br>
   Dad had a way of making ordinary moments unforgettable. Whether taking us to the beach, guiding us on long walks at dawn, or simply watching over us with quiet strength, our father’s presence was steady and sure. He was our guardian, teacher, and role model. His life was his lesson to us—and what a beautiful lesson it was.<br><br>
  He didn’t just live long. He lived well. And though our hearts ache with his absence, we rise every day with the legacy he left—full of faith, kindness, strength, and love. We are eternally grateful to call him our father. And we will carry his light forward.<br><br> </p>

  <h2>From the Grandchildren</h2>
    <p>On May 1st, 2025, we received the heartbreaking news that our beloved 
    Grandpa had passed away. The pain of your absence is deep, and we will 
    miss you dearly. <br><br>

    You were a truly special person; gentle, wise, and full of love. Your warm 
    smiles, your patient correction when we went astray, and your calm, kind 
    presence meant so much to us. You guided us not only with words, but 
    with actions rooted in your strong Christian faith. Though we are filled with 
    sorrow, we find comfort in knowing that you now rest in the arms of the 
    Lord. Life and death are part of God’s perfect plan, and while we grieve, 
    we also give thanks for the time we had with you. <br><br>

    You always encouraged us to be our best. In your memory, we will wipe 
    away our tears, work hard, and live lives that would make you proud. That 
    is your legacy, and we will carry it forward. 
    Rest in perfect peace, Grandpa. We will love and remember you 
    always. </p>

    <h2>TRIBUTE FROM COUSINS</h2>
 <p>In every family, there’s that one person who seems to live by a silent code, 
unspoken but consistent, like a metronome in the background. For us, that 
person was our cousin, Samuel Winifred Nii Offei Dodoo, whom we fondly 
called Nii Offei. Quiet? Yes. Reserved? Definitely. Predictable? Never!
 Growing up in the bustling Teshie-Nungua Estate home under the 
watchful (and sometimes daunting) eye of Uncle T.A. Nelson-Cofie, the 
house was always filled with energy, children coming and going, laughter 
echoing through the halls, and debates over who had finished the last cup 
of tea. Yet somehow, Nii Offei maintained a sense of calm in the middle 
of the chaos.<br><br>
 He wasn’t loud, but you always knew he was there. Maybe it was the 
sound of his broom as he diligently swept his already spotless room (we 
suspect he swept out of habit, not necessity). Or perhaps it was the faint 
aroma of one of his mysterious but perfectly balanced meals. Yes, he 
could cook! And no, we don’t know where he learned it, but what we do 
know is that no one, absolutely no one, was going to bluff him with food. 
Not even his wife. Ask her.<br><br>
 His neatness was legendary. You could eat off his floor, though he would 
not have approved of that at all. His shirts were always pressed, shoes 
shining, and you could spot the crisp lines in his trousers from across the 
compound. We used to joke that his wardrobe must’ve had a personal 
butler. And when it came to food or drink? Let’s just say if it didn’t pass 
the Nii Offei Inspection Protocol, it wasn’t going in.<br><br>
 But beyond the neatness, the order, and the enviable culinary skills, what 
we cherish most was his quiet friendship. He was the cousin you could sit 
beside without needing to talk. And when he did speak, oh, the dry wit! 
He’d drop a line so unexpected, we’d all be caught mid-laugh, wondering 
how the quietest among us had just landed the best joke of the evening.
 He was our brother, our friend, our "calm in the storm." A steady soul who 
made our shared childhood richer and our adulthood more reflective. His 
presence taught us that warmth doesn’t always have to be loud, and 
friendship doesn’t always come with fanfare.<br><br>
 We miss you already, Nii Offei. But we smile when we think of your quietly 
raised eyebrow when someone left their shoes crooked… or your amused 
grin when someone attempted to challenge your cooking. Heaven has 
gained not just a saint, but the cleanest room it’s ever seen.
 Rest well, dear cousin. And don’t worry, we’re keeping the place tidy.</p>

A Tribute to Our Beloved Brother, Late Mr. Sammy Winfred Dodoo

These are his old-time friends: Benjamin Okine Doku (aka Okunyin); Ebenezer Kofi Aryee (Captain of Kofi Nenyi); Joseph Kwesi Aryee ( Kwesi);  Aaron Abeiku Apen Aryee ( Abei) and Seth Odei Awuah (Kwesi or Seth)

We first met Sammy in 1982 through his friend, Mr. Benjamin Okine Doku, at the National Tobacco company. At the time, we were all bachelors living in Communities 7 and 8. We were drawn to Sammy’s gentle nature, deep voice, and unique expression, which initially made us think he was Jamaican. Our shared love for singing hymns and choral songs brought us closer together.

A Group of Like-Minded Friends

Our group, centered on Christ, welcomed Sammy with open arms. We subscribed to “The Sword of the Lord,” a Christian paper edited by Rev. Dr. John R. Rice. We introduced Sammy to this publication, and he grew to love it. We often discussed Christ and church-related topics.

Coming to Faith

We invited Sammy to a preaching program at Regular Baptist Church, where an American preacher shared the Gospel. Sammy responded and accepted the Lord. Later, when some of us became Baptists, Sammy joined us at TRBC.

Music and Ministry

When the church choir was revived in 1986, Sammy was among the first to join. After I left for ministerial training, he stopped attending choir practices. Despite our physical distance, our friendship endured.

A Lasting Legacy

What’s remarkable is that I named most of his children and one of his grandchildren. We cherished Sammy’s kind heart and brotherly love. Even when life took us in different directions, we remained connected until illness took its toll.

A Final Goodbye

On a Friday, after a marriage engagement, I received an unexpected call. Sammy’s daughter, Naa Dodowa, shared the news of his passing. The news took away my appetite, but I found comfort in knowing we’ll meet again in heaven.

Farewell, Dear Brother

Rest well, Sammy, in the Lord’s presence. You paved the way, and we’ll follow if Jesus tarries.
Fare thee well.

    <h2>TRIBUTE BY BROTHERS AND SISTERS </h2>
<p><i>“For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have 
a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human 
hands.” </i>– 2 Corinthians 5:1 <br><br>
We gather today not just in mourning, but in deep reverence and 
celebration of a life well lived, our dear brother, Nii Ofei. Fondly called so 
by all who knew him, he was a unique soul, reserved, thoughtful, and 
quietly impactful. Born on the 23rd of May, just as our dear mother was, 
he carried her spirit in many ways: gentle, observant, and nurturing. 
Though naturally an introvert, there was a depth of conviction and strength 
within him that only surfaced when truly provoked. As the old Klemesiu 
saying goes, “He barked but did not bite”, a quiet storm with an inner core 
of discipline and principle. <br><br>
<h3>A CHILD OF DESTINY AND DETERMINATION </h3>
Nii Ofei lost his biological father at the tender age of two. It was a loss that 
left a void too deep to fill, but in his childlike innocence, he once stormed 
into our grandmother Afadua Ansah’s house, demanding to see his father. 
That moment broke the hearts of all present, it was as if the pain of the 
past had been freshly revived. But out of this sorrow came the light of 
guidance and structure. <br><br>
He was embraced by the late Mr. T. A. Nelson-Cofie, a distinguished 
lawyer, jurist, elder of the church, and a gifted organist. This father figure 
became his mentor and guide. From him, Nii Ofei absorbed the virtues of 
discipline, humility, respect, and above all, Christian values. Under this 
tutelage, our brother grew into a man of strong moral fiber, reserved but 
radiant, humble yet principled. <br><br>
He was a man who lived what he believed. He often said, “We are like 
tents. After our earthly duties, we are taken off to eternity.” That profound 
view of life, his quiet awareness of the temporariness of this world, shaped 
his actions and choices. He never embarked on a task unless he was 
confident he could see it through. It was one of the many lessons he 
taught us, just by living it. <br><br>
<h3>THE LIGHT HE SHARED </h3>
To us, his brothers and sisters, Nii Ofei was a light. He didn’t seek the 
spotlight, but somehow, he stood out. In family gatherings, his presence 
was grounding. He didn’t speak much, but when he did, it carried weight. 
He didn’t command attention, but his actions commanded respect. He 
made us laugh, he made us think, and above all, he reminded us, often in 
his silent, powerful way, of the importance of staying true to who you are. 
As we bid him farewell, we do so with both tears and thanksgiving. Tears, 
because we will miss him dearly. Thanksgiving, because we were blessed 
to have shared this life journey with him. His legacy is not in monuments 
or loud achievements, it is in the kindness he showed, the values he lived, 
and the love he gave. <br><br>
May your gentle soul rest in perfect peace, dear brother, until we meet 
again in the warm embrace of our Creator, where angels and archangels 
forever sing, “Hallelujah” in praise of the Almighty Father. 
With all our love, <br>
Your Brothers and Sisters </p>

    <h2>TRIBUTE FROM NAOMI ANTOBAM DODOO ALSO KNOWN as AtofoNye</h2>

00 Nii Ofei, the elders called you aa nanyo (Friend) and your response was aa mame and aa papa respectively. Mother earth has taken you away / dear one from us.<br><br>
We mourn you. We will shed tears all day long. Some in months, others the pain as a result of your exist will take a toll on them for years to come, but to no avail. As human the pleasant happy moment we shared together will ever echo in our ears and deepen our sorrows. Yet the light of God always returns and transforms darkness into magic and the Words of God becomes an anchor throughout our life stream.<br><br>
What we cherish most was your quiet friendship caught up in smiles. The smiles hardly died down in the midst of jokes whilst we laugh it off.
We have lost more than a brother, we have lost a friend too, and a role model. In the midst of these qualities Gods graciously gives us life abundantly and to die is our lot as our cradle stands in the grave. We are comforted; you are with the Lord whom you served diligently throughout your life stream.<br><br>
Fare thee well, Brother Nii Ofei, friend, aa nanyo rest in perfect peace in the Lord.
We leave you with A and M Hymnal 401. Last verse
Earth to earth and dust to dust calmly now the words we say, leaving him to sleep in trust till the resurrection day. Father in thy gracious keeping leave we now thy servant sleeping.
