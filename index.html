                <p><u>23rd May, 1948 – 1st May, 2025</u>

                    <i>“Revelation Verses 9–17: “A great multitude from every nation, clothed in white robes and holding palm branches, stands before the throne of God and the Lamb (Jesus). They worship and serve God continually. It is revealed that they came out of the great tribulation. God promises to shelter them, wipe away their tears, and give them eternal peace.”</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo, affectionately called Nii Offei, was born on 23rd May 1948 at Kimbu Hospital in Accra to Mr. Benjamin Ernest Okoe Dodoo of the Klemeno Dynasty and Madam Rose Naadu Nelson Addico of Addico We, Prampram – both of blessed memory.
                    <br><br>
                    Though he lost his father at the tender age of two, young Nii Offei was embraced by the strong arms of family. He was raised under the watchful care of his uncle, the late Lawyer T.A. Nelson-Cofie, a respected figure who had just returned from the UK. A man of deep Christian faith, he was baptized at just three years old at St. Michael’s Anglican Church, Korle Gonno, in December 1951. Nii Offei began his education at the Salvation Army School near Mamprobi in 1954, completing in 1964. He furthered his studies at Osu Salem Secondary School, laying a strong academic foundation that would serve him well in his professional life.
                    His spiritual journey was shaped by his upbringing in a devout Christian household, where his uncle was both church elder and choirmaster at Teshie-Nungua United Church. There, Nii Offei found his place in the choir, singing bass with a deep, rich voice that echoed his soulful character. He never missed a rehearsal – the music, the harmony, the fellowship – it was all part of his life’s rhythm.
                    <br><br>
                    The household in Teshie-Nungua Estates was a lively one, filled with siblings and cousins, yet Nii Offei stood out – quiet, composed, and always impeccably mannered. Though reserved by nature, he had a sharp wit and when he did speak, his humor would leave everyone in stitches.
                    <br><br>
                    He started his career at the National Tobacco Rehandling Company Ltd at Tema, where he served diligently as an Accounts Officer. His commitment to duty was unwavering, and he quickly became known as a man of integrity and quiet diligence. There a colleague called Mr. Doku introduced him to Tema Regual Baptist Church .
                    It was during this season that he met the love of his life, Miss Rita Addo-Yobo – a woman of grace and strength, known for her generosity and spiritual fervor. Their union was blessed with five children: Mrs. Clara Naa Dodua Omilana Dodoo, Teresa Naa Amponsah Dodoo, Nii Amu Dodoo, Mrs. Rosaline Naa Tsetse Adafia, and Samuel Percy Dodoo. He also had a daughter from an earlier relationship, also named Seyram Naa Dodua Dodoo. His legacy lives on in them, and in his eight adoring grandchildren
                    <br><br>

                    When the company was liquidated in the early 1990s as part of Ghana’s economic reform and divestiture program, Nii Offei received his residence in Community 8, Tema as part of his terminal benefits – a place that would became his home and sanctuary for the remainder of his life.
                    <br><br>
                    Following his work at the tobacco company, Nii Offei continued to serve his community as the Administrative manager and Accountant of Tema Regular Baptist Academy (TRBA) He served with passion and commitment for 25 remarkable years, There, he was deeply respected by both staff and students, not just for his work ethic, but for the quiet wisdom and kindness he carried with him.
                    He was employed in the School on the 5th of January 1995 and retired in June 2020 when his health began to fail him. . 
                    <br><br>
                    Though soft-spoken, Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo was a man of great depth – thoughtful, humorous in the most unexpected moments, faithful in service, and unwavering in love for his family and God.

                    He left behind a legacy rooted in humility, laughter, music, and quiet strength.
                    <br><br>
                    Rest well, Nii Offei. You sang your part beautifully.
                    <br>
                    MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PERFECT PEACE</p>

               Eeeeeh Hmm Awwww Awwww Eeeeeh, O Lord by your mercy let your Grace give me the
               strength to stand this tremor.
               It seems like it was only yesterday but its four decades when we got married 7 July 1985, I
               had the honor of being the wife and partner of a great, loving, kind and God fearing man.
               Ossman, as I affectionately caled him. I stand before this crowd to read this tribute in honor
               of you. It felt like a dream writing this tribute with my heart troubled and eyes filed with tears.
               <br><br>
               1st May 2025 was a day of tremor and anguish. It was a day my whole world crushed on me.
               Fear, sadness and shock-waves passed through my body. Exactly at about 6:30pm you
               answered your cal to your maker right in front of me whilst giving you food.
               <br><br>
               Oh death a necessary end wil come when it wil. I am privilege to have had the chance to
               share in your love, friendship, hope, aspiration and much more. 
               A great chef, a man who made others laugh. You wil always be in my heart and my love for
               you wil last forever, I wil always remember you.
               The children and I wil always pray for you.
               May God grant you eternal rest, and may the Angles of God welcome you into paradise.
               Rest in peace my Love. Til we meet again in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ

                <p>If strength had a quiet voice, and wisdom wore a smile, it would look and sound like our father, Mr. Samuel Winfred Dodoo. Calm yet firm, gentle yet principled—he was a man whose love spoke louder in action than in words. He didn’t just raise children; he nurtured hearts, built character, and shaped futures with patience, discipline, and unwavering devotion. <br><br>
                He showed us what unconditional love truly means.Dad lived generously. Every year on his birthday—and often even before—he would quietly send out gifts to widows and widowers in the community. He was a giver at heart, and service was his joy. A quiet, calm, and collected man, he carried a witty charm and a sense of humor that made him unforgettable.<br><br>
                Our home was always filled with music—his deep love for hymns and melodies echoing from his keyboard and his soul. His voice could lift a room, and his joy for the great hymns of old lives on through us. He was also a man of deep intellect—a lover of books, Scripture, and the news. He instilled in us a hunger for knowledge, a respect for words, and a passion for excellence. His corrections made us smarter. His example made us better.<br><br>
                Dad had a way of making ordinary moments unforgettable. Whether taking us to the beach, guiding us on long walks at dawn, or simply watching over us with quiet strength, our father’s presence was steady and sure. He was our guardian, teacher, and role model. His life was his lesson to us—and what a beautiful lesson it was.<br><br>
                He didn’t just live long. He lived well. And though our hearts ache with his absence, we rise every day with the legacy he left—full of faith, kindness, strength, and love. We are eternally grateful to call him our father. And we will carry his light forward.<br><br> </p>

                <p>Samuel was more than a neighbor; he was family. For fifteen years, our families shared countless moments of joy, celebration, and support. His presence in our community made it a better place for everyone.</p>
                
                <p>Samuel had a unique ability to bring out the best in everyone around him. His legacy lives on in all of us. Whether it was organizing community clean-up days, helping students with their studies, or simply being available to listen when someone needed a friend, Samuel was always there.</p>
                
                <p>I'll never forget how he helped our family during our most difficult times. When my husband was ill, Samuel organized meals, transportation, and prayers. He never asked for recognition or thanks; he simply did what he believed was right.</p>
                
                <p>His garden was legendary in our neighborhood. Samuel would spend hours tending to his plants, but the joy came in sharing the harvest with everyone. His door was always open, his table always had room for one more, and his heart always had space for another friend.</p>
                
                <p>The children in our area adored him. Uncle Samuel, as they called him, would help with homework, teach them about plants and nature, and always had time for their questions. He believed that investing in children was investing in the future of our community.</p>
                
                <p>We are all better people for having known Samuel. His spirit of generosity, his commitment to community, and his genuine love for others will continue to inspire us long after his passing.</p>

            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>I had the honor of calling Samuel my friend for over twenty-five years. From our university days to our professional careers, he was a constant source of inspiration and joy.</p>
                
                <p>Samuel was a true gentleman who touched lives with his generosity, humor, and genuine care for others. He had this remarkable ability to make everyone feel important and valued. No matter how busy he was, he always had time for a friend in need.</p>
                
                <p>Our weekly chess games became a tradition that I will cherish forever. Samuel was a formidable opponent, not just because of his strategic mind, but because he made every game an opportunity to share wisdom, laughter, and friendship. Even when he was winning (which was often), he was encouraging and supportive.</p>
                
                <p>His success in business was matched only by his generosity in giving back. Samuel quietly supported numerous students through their education, helped small businesses get started, and contributed to countless community projects. He believed that success was meaningless unless it was shared.</p>
                
                <p>What I admired most about Samuel was his authenticity. He was the same person whether he was in a boardroom or at a family gathering. His values never wavered, his integrity never faltered, and his commitment to doing what was right never diminished.</p>
                
                <p>Samuel taught me that true wealth is measured not in what we accumulate, but in what we give and how we treat others. His friendship was one of the greatest gifts of my life.</p>
