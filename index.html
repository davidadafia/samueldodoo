                <p><u>23rd May, 1948 – 1st May, 2025</u>

                    <i>“Revelation Verses 9–17: “A great multitude from every nation, clothed in white robes and holding palm branches, stands before the throne of God and the Lamb (Jesus). They worship and serve God continually. It is revealed that they came out of the great tribulation. God promises to shelter them, wipe away their tears, and give them eternal peace.”</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo, affectionately called Nii Offei, was born on 23rd May 1948 at Kimbu Hospital in Accra to Mr. Benjamin Ernest Okoe Dodoo of the Klemeno Dynasty and Madam Rose Naadu Nelson Addico of Addico We, Prampram – both of blessed memory.
                    <br><br>
                    Though he lost his father at the tender age of two, young Nii Offei was embraced by the strong arms of family. He was raised under the watchful care of his uncle, the late Lawyer T.A. Nelson-Cofie, a respected figure who had just returned from the UK. A man of deep Christian faith, he was baptized at just three years old at St. Michael’s Anglican Church, Korle Gonno, in December 1951. Nii Offei began his education at the Salvation Army School near Mamprobi in 1954, completing in 1964. He furthered his studies at Osu Salem Secondary School, laying a strong academic foundation that would serve him well in his professional life.
                    His spiritual journey was shaped by his upbringing in a devout Christian household, where his uncle was both church elder and choirmaster at Teshie-Nungua United Church. There, Nii Offei found his place in the choir, singing bass with a deep, rich voice that echoed his soulful character. He never missed a rehearsal – the music, the harmony, the fellowship – it was all part of his life’s rhythm.
                    <br><br>
                    The household in Teshie-Nungua Estates was a lively one, filled with siblings and cousins, yet Nii Offei stood out – quiet, composed, and always impeccably mannered. Though reserved by nature, he had a sharp wit and when he did speak, his humor would leave everyone in stitches.
                    <br><br>
                    He started his career at the National Tobacco Rehandling Company Ltd at Tema, where he served diligently as an Accounts Officer. His commitment to duty was unwavering, and he quickly became known as a man of integrity and quiet diligence. There a colleague called Mr. Doku introduced him to Tema Regual Baptist Church .
                    It was during this season that he met the love of his life, Miss Rita Addo-Yobo – a woman of grace and strength, known for her generosity and spiritual fervor. Their union was blessed with five children: Mrs. Clara Naa Dodua Omilana Dodoo, Teresa Naa Amponsah Dodoo, Nii Amu Dodoo, Mrs. Rosaline Naa Tsetse Adafia, and Samuel Percy Dodoo. He also had a daughter from an earlier relationship, also named Seyram Naa Dodua Dodoo. His legacy lives on in them, and in his eight adoring grandchildren
                    <br><br>

                    When the company was liquidated in the early 1990s as part of Ghana’s economic reform and divestiture program, Nii Offei received his residence in Community 8, Tema as part of his terminal benefits – a place that would became his home and sanctuary for the remainder of his life.
                    <br><br>
                    Following his work at the tobacco company, Nii Offei continued to serve his community as the Administrative manager and Accountant of Tema Regular Baptist Academy (TRBA) He served with passion and commitment for 25 remarkable years, There, he was deeply respected by both staff and students, not just for his work ethic, but for the quiet wisdom and kindness he carried with him.
                    He was employed in the School on the 5th of January 1995 and retired in June 2020 when his health began to fail him. . 
                    <br><br>
                    Though soft-spoken, Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Ofei Dodoo was a man of great depth – thoughtful, humorous in the most unexpected moments, faithful in service, and unwavering in love for his family and God.

                    He left behind a legacy rooted in humility, laughter, music, and quiet strength.
                    <br><br>
                    Rest well, Nii Offei. You sang your part beautifully.
                    <br>
                    MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PERFECT PEACE</p>

               Eeeeeh Hmm Awwww Awwww Eeeeeh, O Lord by your mercy let your Grace give me the
               strength to stand this tremor.
               It seems like it was only yesterday but its four decades when we got married 7 July 1985, I
               had the honor of being the wife and partner of a great, loving, kind and God fearing man.
               Ossman, as I affectionately caled him. I stand before this crowd to read this tribute in honor
               of you. It felt like a dream writing this tribute with my heart troubled and eyes filed with tears.
               <br><br>
               1st May 2025 was a day of tremor and anguish. It was a day my whole world crushed on me.
               Fear, sadness and shock-waves passed through my body. Exactly at about 6:30pm you
               answered your cal to your maker right in front of me whilst giving you food.
               <br><br>
               Oh death a necessary end wil come when it wil. I am privilege to have had the chance to
               share in your love, friendship, hope, aspiration and much more. 
               A great chef, a man who made others laugh. You wil always be in my heart and my love for
               you wil last forever, I wil always remember you.
               The children and I wil always pray for you.
               May God grant you eternal rest, and may the Angles of God welcome you into paradise.
               Rest in peace my Love. Til we meet again in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ

                <p>If strength had a quiet voice, and wisdom wore a smile, it would look and sound like our father, Mr. Samuel Winfred Dodoo. Calm yet firm, gentle yet principled—he was a man whose love spoke louder in action than in words. He didn’t just raise children; he nurtured hearts, built character, and shaped futures with patience, discipline, and unwavering devotion. <br><br>
                He showed us what unconditional love truly means.Dad lived generously. Every year on his birthday—and often even before—he would quietly send out gifts to widows and widowers in the community. He was a giver at heart, and service was his joy. A quiet, calm, and collected man, he carried a witty charm and a sense of humor that made him unforgettable.<br><br>
                Our home was always filled with music—his deep love for hymns and melodies echoing from his keyboard and his soul. His voice could lift a room, and his joy for the great hymns of old lives on through us. He was also a man of deep intellect—a lover of books, Scripture, and the news. He instilled in us a hunger for knowledge, a respect for words, and a passion for excellence. His corrections made us smarter. His example made us better.<br><br>
                Dad had a way of making ordinary moments unforgettable. Whether taking us to the beach, guiding us on long walks at dawn, or simply watching over us with quiet strength, our father’s presence was steady and sure. He was our guardian, teacher, and role model. His life was his lesson to us—and what a beautiful lesson it was.<br><br>
                He didn’t just live long. He lived well. And though our hearts ache with his absence, we rise every day with the legacy he left—full of faith, kindness, strength, and love. We are eternally grateful to call him our father. And we will carry his light forward.<br><br> </p>

                <p><i>“For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have 
                a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human 
                hands.” </i>– 2 Corinthians 5:1 <br><br>
                We gather today not just in mourning, but in deep reverence and 
                celebration of a life well lived, our dear brother, Nii Ofei. Fondly called so 
                by all who knew him, he was a unique soul, reserved, thoughtful, and 
                quietly impactful. Born on the 23rd of May, just as our dear mother was, 
                he carried her spirit in many ways: gentle, observant, and nurturing. 
                Though naturally an introvert, there was a depth of conviction and strength 
                within him that only surfaced when truly provoked. As the old Klemesiu 
                saying goes, “He barked but did not bite”, a quiet storm with an inner core 
                of discipline and principle. <br><br>
                <h3>A CHILD OF DESTINY AND DETERMINATION </h3>
                Nii Ofei lost his biological father at the tender age of two. It was a loss that 
                left a void too deep to fill, but in his childlike innocence, he once stormed 
                into our grandmother Afadua Ansah’s house, demanding to see his father. 
                That moment broke the hearts of all present, it was as if the pain of the 
                past had been freshly revived. But out of this sorrow came the light of 
                guidance and structure. <br><br>
                He was embraced by the late Mr. T. A. Nelson-Cofie, a distinguished 
                lawyer, jurist, elder of the church, and a gifted organist. This father figure 
                became his mentor and guide. From him, Nii Ofei absorbed the virtues of 
                discipline, humility, respect, and above all, Christian values. Under this 
                tutelage, our brother grew into a man of strong moral fiber, reserved but 
                radiant, humble yet principled. <br><br>
                He was a man who lived what he believed. He often said, “We are like 
                tents. After our earthly duties, we are taken off to eternity.” That profound 
                view of life, his quiet awareness of the temporariness of this world, shaped 
                his actions and choices. He never embarked on a task unless he was 
                confident he could see it through. It was one of the many lessons he 
                taught us, just by living it. <br><br>
                <h3>THE LIGHT HE SHARED </h3>
                To us, his brothers and sisters, Nii Ofei was a light. He didn’t seek the 
                spotlight, but somehow, he stood out. In family gatherings, his presence 
                was grounding. He didn’t speak much, but when he did, it carried weight. 
                He didn’t command attention, but his actions commanded respect. He 
                made us laugh, he made us think, and above all, he reminded us, often in 
                his silent, powerful way, of the importance of staying true to who you are. 
                As we bid him farewell, we do so with both tears and thanksgiving. Tears, 
                because we will miss him dearly. Thanksgiving, because we were blessed 
                to have shared this life journey with him. His legacy is not in monuments 
                or loud achievements, it is in the kindness he showed, the values he lived, 
                and the love he gave. <br><br>
                May your gentle soul rest in perfect peace, dear brother, until we meet 
                again in the warm embrace of our Creator, where angels and archangels 
                forever sing, “Hallelujah” in praise of the Almighty Father. 
                With all our love, <br>

            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>In every family, there’s that one person who seems to live by a silent code, 
                unspoken but consistent, like a metronome in the background. For us, that 
                person was our cousin, Samuel Winifred Nii Offei Dodoo, whom we fondly 
                called Nii Offei. Quiet? Yes. Reserved? Definitely. Predictable? Never!
                 Growing up in the bustling Teshie-Nungua Estate home under the 
                watchful (and sometimes daunting) eye of Uncle T.A. Nelson-Cofie, the 
                house was always filled with energy, children coming and going, laughter 
                echoing through the halls, and debates over who had finished the last cup 
                of tea. Yet somehow, Nii Offei maintained a sense of calm in the middle 
                of the chaos.<br><br>
                 He wasn’t loud, but you always knew he was there. Maybe it was the 
                sound of his broom as he diligently swept his already spotless room (we 
                suspect he swept out of habit, not necessity). Or perhaps it was the faint 
                aroma of one of his mysterious but perfectly balanced meals. Yes, he 
                could cook! And no, we don’t know where he learned it, but what we do 
                know is that no one, absolutely no one, was going to bluff him with food. 
                Not even his wife. Ask her.<br><br>
                 His neatness was legendary. You could eat off his floor, though he would 
                not have approved of that at all. His shirts were always pressed, shoes 
                shining, and you could spot the crisp lines in his trousers from across the 
                compound. We used to joke that his wardrobe must’ve had a personal 
                butler. And when it came to food or drink? Let’s just say if it didn’t pass 
                the Nii Offei Inspection Protocol, it wasn’t going in.<br><br>
                 But beyond the neatness, the order, and the enviable culinary skills, what 
                we cherish most was his quiet friendship. He was the cousin you could sit 
                beside without needing to talk. And when he did speak, oh, the dry wit! 
                He’d drop a line so unexpected, we’d all be caught mid-laugh, wondering 
                how the quietest among us had just landed the best joke of the evening.
                 He was our brother, our friend, our "calm in the storm." A steady soul who 
                made our shared childhood richer and our adulthood more reflective. His 
                presence taught us that warmth doesn’t always have to be loud, and 
                friendship doesn’t always come with fanfare.<br><br>
                 We miss you already, Nii Offei. But we smile when we think of your quietly 
                raised eyebrow when someone left their shoes crooked… or your amused 
                grin when someone attempted to challenge your cooking. Heaven has 
                gained not just a saint, but the cleanest room it’s ever seen.
                 Rest well, dear cousin. And don’t worry, we’re keeping the place tidy.</p>

                <p>On May 1st, 2025, we received the heartbreaking news that our beloved 
                Grandpa had passed away. The pain of your absence is deep, and we will 
                miss you dearly. <br><br>

                You were a truly special person; gentle, wise, and full of love. Your warm 
                smiles, your patient correction when we went astray, and your calm, kind 
                presence meant so much to us. You guided us not only with words, but 
                with actions rooted in your strong Christian faith. Though we are filled with 
                sorrow, we find comfort in knowing that you now rest in the arms of the 
                Lord. Life and death are part of God’s perfect plan, and while we grieve, 
                we also give thanks for the time we had with you. <br><br>

                You always encouraged us to be our best. In your memory, we will wipe 
                away our tears, work hard, and live lives that would make you proud. That 
                is your legacy, and we will carry it forward. 
                Rest in perfect peace, Grandpa. We will love and remember you 
                always. </p>

              Daddy was more than a father-in-law — he was a pillar of
              strength, wisdom, and quiet kindness. He treated each of
              us with respect, warmth, and generosity, and made us feel

              We honour his life, his legacy, and the love he gave so
              freely. He will be deeply missed, but always remembered
              with gratitude and love.
              Rest well, Daddy.</p>

These are his old-time friends: Benjamin Okine Doku (aka Okunyin); Ebenezer Kofi Aryee (Captain of Kofi Nenyi); Joseph Kwesi Aryee ( Kwesi);  Aaron Abeiku Apen Aryee ( Abei) and Seth Odei Awuah (Kwesi or Seth)
<br><br>
We first met Sammy in 1982 through his friend, Mr. Benjamin Okine Doku, at the National Tobacco company. At the time, we were all bachelors living in Communities 7 and 8. We were drawn to Sammy’s gentle nature, deep voice, and unique expression, which initially made us think he was Jamaican. Our shared love for singing hymns and choral songs brought us closer together.
<br><br>
A Group of Like-Minded Friends<br>

Our group, centered on Christ, welcomed Sammy with open arms. We subscribed to “The Sword of the Lord,” a Christian paper edited by Rev. Dr. John R. Rice. We introduced Sammy to this publication, and he grew to love it. We often discussed Christ and church-related topics.
<br><br>
Coming to Faith<br>

We invited Sammy to a preaching program at Regular Baptist Church, where an American preacher shared the Gospel. Sammy responded and accepted the Lord. Later, when some of us became Baptists, Sammy joined us at TRBC.
<br><br>
Music and Ministry<br>

When the church choir was revived in 1986, Sammy was among the first to join. After I left for ministerial training, he stopped attending choir practices. Despite our physical distance, our friendship endured.
<br><br>
A Lasting Legacy<br>

What’s remarkable is that I named most of his children and one of his grandchildren. We cherished Sammy’s kind heart and brotherly love. Even when life took us in different directions, we remained connected until illness took its toll.
<br><br>
A Final Goodbye<br>

On a Friday, after a marriage engagement, I received an unexpected call. Sammy’s daughter, Naa Dodowa, shared the news of his passing. The news took away my appetite, but I found comfort in knowing we’ll meet again in heaven.
<br><br>
Farewell, Dear Brother<br>
Rest well, Sammy, in the Lord’s presence. You paved the way, and we’ll follow if Jesus tarries.<br>
Fare thee well.
<br><br>
<h2>TRIBUTE FROM NAOMI ANTOBAM DODOO ALSO KNOWN as AtofoNye</h2>

00 Nii Ofei, the elders called you aa nanyo (Friend) and your response was aa mame and aa papa respectively. Mother earth has taken you away / dear one from us.<br><br>
We mourn you. We will shed tears all day long. Some in months, others the pain as a result of your exist will take a toll on them for years to come, but to no avail. As human the pleasant happy moment we shared together will ever echo in our ears and deepen our sorrows. Yet the light of God always returns and transforms darkness into magic and the Words of God becomes an anchor throughout our life stream.<br><br>
What we cherish most was your quiet friendship caught up in smiles. The smiles hardly died down in the midst of jokes whilst we laugh it off.
We have lost more than a brother, we have lost a friend too, and a role model. In the midst of these qualities Gods graciously gives us life abundantly and to die is our lot as our cradle stands in the grave. We are comforted; you are with the Lord whom you served diligently throughout your life stream.<br><br>
Fare thee well, Brother Nii Ofei, friend, aa nanyo rest in perfect peace in the Lord.
We leave you with A and M Hymnal 401. Last verse
Earth to earth and dust to dust calmly now the words we say, leaving him to sleep in trust till the resurrection day. Father in thy gracious keeping leave we now thy servant sleeping.

              <p> “For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain” - Philippians 1:21 “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints” 
Psalm 116:15 <br><br>
The late Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Offei Dodoo has paid his dues in serving the lord here at Tema Regular Baptist church in
 various capacities as a member, administrator, Chorister, just to name a few. He had a calm demeanor and a high affinity for
 music. <br><br>
Having received the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Saviour, Mr. Samuel Winfred Dodoo was baptized and became a
 devoted member of the United Church at Teshie Nungua Estate, where he resided at the time. 
As time went on, he moved on from the United Church and joined the Ebenezer Baptist Church, also at Teshie Nungua
 Estate. Upon relocating to Tema, his deep love for the Lord and willingness to serve wherever he was led him to meet Brother
 Benjamin Doku, a member of the Tema Regular Baptist Church. Through this encounter, he was introduced to and warmly
 welcomed into the Tema Regular Baptist Church.
<br><br>
 After transferring his membership from the sister church at Teshie Nungua Estate, Mr. Dodoo wholeheartedly committed
 himself to serving the Lord at Tema Regular Baptist Church. As a full member, he diligently took part in Bible studies, prayer
 meetings, evangelistic outreaches, and visitation programmes. <br><br>
In the ministry of music, he was no exception. Gifted with a melodious voice, he actively participated in song ministrations and
 often taught the choir new hymns. Beyond singing, he dedicated himself to maintaining the house of God, ensuring it was
 always clean, tidy, and well prepared for Sunday worship services. <br><br>
Mr. Dodoo was known for his humility, faithfulness, and gentle nature. He spoke softly and was a man of few words, yet his
 love for all brethren was evident to all who knew him. He served the Lord with sincerity and touched many lives through his
 quiet but steadfast commitment. <br><br>
We will always remember Mr. Samuel Winfred Nii Offei Dodoo, we would always remember your commitment in serving the
 lord and the indelible footprint you have left behind both the church and the school. </p>

              <p>  Today, we gather to celebrate the life and legacy of Mr. Samuel Winfred Dodoo, a
 dedicated member of Tema Regular Baptist Academy (TRBA) who served with
 passion and commitment for 25 remarkable years, He was employed in the School
 on the 5th of January 1995 and retired in June 2020 when his health began to fail
 him. 

 <br><br>His tireless efforts, kindness, Humility and expertise touched countless lives,
 inspiring students, co leagues, and staff alike. Samuel Winfred Dodoo's dedication to
 our school's mission and values wil forever be remembered and cherished.
 He loved Singing and was always inspired by Hymns and worship songs.
 Mr. Dodoo was the Administrative Manager and Accountant of Tema Regular
 Baptist Academy. He was the ultimate team player and would never refuse any
 assignment given to him.
<br><br>
  He would focus on achieving results and never sought recognition for any work he
 did. Some of his achievements included his work with Monsieur Souleymane to come
 out with the TRBA school crest. He also worked with the school administration office
 on projects including the design and introduction of the school uniform, Friday wear,
 and School Hymn Book. After the completion of the School Hymn book he was
 assigned the role of a music teacher going from class to class to teach the hymns in
 the book to the school children.
 <br>
 Mr. Dodoo had a cordial relationship with parents and guardians of school children,
 office co leagues and school teachers. But he did not countenance teachers caning
 school children.
 <br><br>
 As we say goodbye to our beloved former coleague, we take comfort in the
 memories we shared with him. May his legacy continue to inspire us to serve with
 compassion, integrity, and exce lence. Our thoughts and prayers are with your family
 and loved ones during this difficult time. May your soul rest in perfect peace

It’s hard to put into words what you meant to us, Uncle Nii Ofei.

As your nieces and nephews who loved you deeply, we come together to honour your life, your kindness, and the immeasurable impact you had on each of us. You weren’t just our uncle. You were our mentor, our storyteller, our protector, and the quiet force who brought our family closer together.
<br><br>
We will always remember visiting you in Tema. Your home wasn’t just a place, it was a feeling. The moment we walked through the door, we felt welcome, the warmth, and a sense of belonging. You made each of us feel special and safe. Whether it was through the stories you told, the thoughtful gifts you gave, or the simple way you listened.
<br><br>
You had a gift for bringing people together, young and old, near and far. We watched how you held the family close, how your presence could calm a room or fill it with laughter. You were warm, yet strong. Gentle, yet wise. And always, always protective of the people you loved.
<br><br>
Your stories will stay with us. Not just the ones you told us, but the ones you lived. Stories of generosity, strength, humility, and love. You taught us that family is something we nurture, that presence matters more than perfection, and that love can be shown in the quietest ways.
<br><br>
Losing you leaves a space we cannot fill. But we carry your memory in each of us through the lessons you taught us, the laughter you shared, and the legacy you leave behind in this family you helped shape.
<br><br>
Thank you, Uncle Nii Ofei for everything. We love you. We miss you. And we will never forget you.
<br>
Rest in peace.

                 <i>“Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, ‘Write this: Happy are those who from now on die in the service of the Lord!’ ‘Yes indeed!’ answers the spirit. ‘They will enjoy rest from their hard work, because the results of their service go with them.’” — Revelations 14:13</i>
<br><br>
I am proud to say that Nii Ofei, was a trusted brother, frank, sincere and a kind gentleman. As we celebrate his life on earth today, I am glad to say that he left behind a committed and dedicated life.
<br><br>

We first crossed each other’s path in the early part of nineteen eighty-one(1981) when we worked together at the Accounts Office of the defunct National Tobacco Rehandling Co. Ltd. in Tema.
  <br><br>

We worked from the same office for eleven years until the company was liquidated in 1992.  
By the nature of our work schedule, we handled large volumes of physical cash ( millions of cedis) on  weekly basis.
<br><br>

I must say at this juncture that he was diligent, trustworthy, truthful, sincere, and reliable and above all,  God fearing.
  
We lived together as neighbours only separated by a common fence wall between our households.  
Throughout the forty years that I have known Mr. Dodoo, he was inspirational, compassionate, and an example to the family and many others. 
<br><br>

He believed in education  with Christian upbringing, and a modest lifestyle. He was a disciplinarian who also gave good guidance, love, and help to many.  
<br><br>

My love for you Mr. Ofei will never wither.  
We will see you again across the river.  
<br><br>

Fare thee well.

They accept people for who they are, without judgment, and are forgiving of others' mistakes. 
Today, we mourn and celebrate the passing of our beloved Winfred Nii Offei Dodoo. He was someone I described as a gentle soul. He was never judgmental of anyone as far as I can remember. From the moment I stepped into the house at Kaneshie as a teenager, I noticed his calm demeanor and how he cultivated an amazing relationship with all his cousins - Patrick, Melody, Priscilla, Kirk, Diana, and I, all young cousins, growing up together in the Kaneshie residence.  <br><br>
It was a remarkable period, a reasonable amount of freedom; however, we sensed that, just like in most Ghanaian households full of young ones growing up, our daily routines and activities were always regimented by quote unquote “the elderly”.  Nii Offei was definitely the exception. He was never satisfied with "that's the way it's always been done.” As the eldest of the cousins, he possessed an indomitable positive attitude and unwavering patience, he always handled the hard stuff well, and always with poise. 
<br><br>As we celebrate him today, did you ever take note that Ossman Davies, as he was known due to his resemblance to the American actor Ossie Davis, always portrayed a radiant smile that lit up a room? Did you also know that Ossman taught himself how to play the piano? He could not wait for his turn for Uncle Tim to teach him.  As a teenager, he had to have some fun, and I remember him sneaking out of the house to go to a big music festival with famous band groups from the USA: vis-à-vis Jimi Hendricks, Sly and the Family Stone, and Santana, etc. I stayed up late to wait for the knock on the window to open the door to get back into the house! Those were absolutely fond memories which I will treasure always.<br><br>
I also remember the day of his very first job at the neighbor, Mr. Laryea’s offices in Tema. I remember him daily dressing up, combing his afro, steadfastly wearing his tie, and proudly setting off each day to work with his new briefcase. He definitely set the standard for his cousins, we learnt what it meant to be an upright, hardworking individual, dedicated to making something of oneself.<br><br>
Losing someone who has had a great effect on your life is one of the most difficult feelings in the world. He was kindhearted, refined in manners, which he maintained throughout his adult years. 
Ossman, you are in my thoughts, our thoughts. You will be missed, but we know you have gone to a better place where you will rest with others gone before you.  <br><br>
We bid your gentle soul farewell, till we meet again, rest in perfect peace.
